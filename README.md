# Neural Networks from Scratch (NNFS Implementation)

This repository contains my implementation of concepts from the book _Neural Networks from Scratch_ by Harrison Kinsley (Sentdex) and Daniel Kukie≈Ça.

The goal of this project is to build a neural network **completely from first principles** using only Python and NumPy ‚Äî no TensorFlow or PyTorch.  
Each file corresponds to a key concept from the book, implemented and explained with comments.
